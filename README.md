## Patient Symptom Analysis and Self diagnosis Project 
 Project: Patient Symptom Analysis and Self Diagnosis 

1st Module: Ambiguous Symptom Entry
Patients describe their symptoms using natural language, where the system processes partial or unclear inputs to identify possible symptoms using advanced matching algorithms (e.g., substring or KMP).

2nd Module: Limited Medical Awareness
Based on the identified symptoms, the system asks targeted yes/no questions to narrow down possibilities and predict the most likely disease using decision analysis techniques.

3rd Module: Shortest Path to Medical Facility
Once a disease is identified, the system calculates the shortest path to the nearest medical facility using graph-based algorithms like Dijkstra's for quick access to care.

4th Module: Prescription and Precaution
After confirming the disease, the system provides a tailored prescription, lifestyle precautions, and advice, ensuring the patient takes immediate steps for recovery.

### Hello, Srujan Kapale üëã

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## üõ† Projects
- Project 1: The Patient Symptom Analysis and Self Diagnosis system is a comprehensive tool designed to enhance the healthcare experience for individuals. It intelligently processes vague or unclear symptom inputs, narrows down diagnoses through targeted questions, ensures quick access to medical facilities, and provides personalized treatment recommendations. With these four integrated modules, the system aims to provide timely and accurate healthcare guidance, empowering patients to make informed decisions while seeking medical attention.



## üöÄ Skills
- C++, Python, JavaScript
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Web Development (React.js, Node.js)
