### Hello, I'm [Praveen Palkar]üëã

I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. Here's a glimpse of my work:

## üõ† Projects
- *Project 1:
- Project: Patient Symptom Analysis and Self Diagnosis 

1st Module: Ambiguous Symptom Entry
Patients describe their symptoms using natural language, where the system processes partial or unclear inputs to identify possible symptoms using advanced matching algorithms (e.g., substring or KMP).

2nd Module: Limited Medical Awareness
Based on the identified symptoms, the system asks targeted yes/no questions to narrow down possibilities and predict the most likely disease using decision analysis techniques.

3rd Module: Shortest Path to Medical Facility
Once a disease is identified, the system calculates the shortest path to the nearest medical facility using graph-based algorithms like Dijkstra's for quick access to care.

4th Module: Prescription and Precaution
After confirming the disease, the system provides a tailored prescription, lifestyle precautions, and advice, ensuring the patient takes immediate steps for recovery.
